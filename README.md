### Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast between text and background for readability.
- Alt text for images to ensure accessibility for visually impaired users.
- Resizable text to maintain legibility on mobile devices and smaller screens.

## AI Tools Usage

### DALL-E
DALL-E was used to generate festive Halloween-themed images, including pumpkins and candy visuals. The challenge was balancing the theme with clarity to ensure the website didn’t appear cluttered while still maintaining a fun aesthetic.

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot was used to assist with the coding process, particularly in debugging and solving HTML and CSS layout issues. It provided suggestions that helped accelerate development.

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Results
The website was tested across different devices and screen sizes using Chrome DevTools. It performed well on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Adjustments were made to improve layout responsiveness and prevent text from touching the screen edges on mobile devices.

### Validation
The HTML and CSS were validated using the W3C validator and Jigsaw. Minor errors related to deprecated elements were found and corrected, ensuring the code adheres to current web standards.

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
The website was deployed on GitHub Pages. During deployment, some issues were encountered with image paths not rendering correctly, which were resolved by updating relative links in the HTML code.

## Reflection on Development Process

### Successes
- Effective use of AI tools, including DALL-E for image generation and GitHub Copilot for code debugging, significantly streamlined the development process.
- The final design achieved the right balance between being visually engaging and functional.

### Challenges
- Integrating AI-generated content with the overall site design presented a challenge in maintaining consistency in the look and feel.
- Some accessibility adjustments were more complex than anticipated, especially ensuring text remained legible against the Halloween-themed background colors.

### Final Thoughts
This project provided valuable insights into how to create a visually themed, engaging website while still prioritizing user experience and accessibility. The use of AI tools was helpful but also required thoughtful adjustments to ensure the final output aligned with the project’s goals.
