## Testing and Validation

### Testing Results
The website was tested across different devices and screen sizes using Chrome DevTools. It performed well on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Adjustments were made to improve layout responsiveness and prevent text from touching the screen edges on mobile devices.

### Validation
Minor errors were identified after deployment and issues with visuals on phones were identified using google extension. 

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
The website was deployed on GitHub Pages. During deployment, some issues were encountered with my images not showing correctly, which were resolved by updating relative links in the HTML code.

## Reflection on Development Process

### Successes
- Effective use of AI tools, significantly streamlined the development process (but not using it too much)
- The final design achieved the right balance between being fun and informative

### Final Thoughts
This project provided valuable insights into how to create a visually themed, engaging website while still prioritizing user experience and accessibility. The use of LMS were useful helpful but also required thoughtful adjustments to ensure the final output aligned with the project’s goals.
