                            <h4>Switch to battery-powered tea lights</h4>

                                <p>It’s obvious, but the safest thing is to not use real flame candles in your pumpkins.
                                    However, whilst you might use battery operated LED candles yourself, this doesn’t
                                    mean other people will – the amount of doorsteps I have seen over the years laden
                                    with lit pumpkins is unbelievable.</p>

                                <p> Make sure you warn your
                                    children to be wary about pumpkins either on the ground or being carried as they may
                                    have a lit flame in them, especially when approaching
                                    decorated doorsteps. If you do have candles lit in your home, never leave them unattended and put them on a heat resistant surface.

                                <p>It’s really hard when trick or treating in the dark to see the ingredients on a

                                    allergic reactions can peak at Halloween.</p>
                                <p>The Anaphylaxis campaign UK recommends you to ask your child not to eat any treats
                                    until you have checked them. Also, be aware that “treat size” versions of popular
                                    brands can contain different ingredients,
                                    so make sure you check ingredients lists </p>

                                <p>If you are trick or treating, make sure that drivers can see you. It’ll be dark

                                </p>

                                <p>When you cross the road, always do so from a safe location (not between parked cars

                                    on a bend), look both ways, and walk instead of running. You don’t want to give any

                                <p>For a safer option, why not try painting your pumpkin face with a bright cartoon
                                    character or be inventive by painting the whole pumpkin in tasteful gold or silver
