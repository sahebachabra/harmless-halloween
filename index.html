                                put it inside, and left your creation on display. Then you, your child, or a pet
                                accidentally knocks over the pumpkin, which also knocks over the flame inside, and sets
                                your curtains or furniture alight. Quite a scary scene, isn’t it?</p>

                                <p>Maybe you’re reading this scenario and thinking it doesn’t seem likely, but incidents
                                like these are more common than you might think. Around one in eight of the dwelling
                                fires we attend are started by naked flames (such as matches or candles).</p>

                            <h4>Check ingredients on sweet packets carefully</h4>
                            <p class="card-text">It’s really hard when trick or treating in the dark to see the
                                ingredients on a random product handed out by a stranger, so it’s not surprising that
                                cases of allergic reactions can peak at Halloween.

                                The Anaphylaxis campaign recommends the following to parents of allergy sufferers:

                                Remind your child what their food allergens look like, and which products they need to
                                be careful with
                                Ask your child not to eat any treats until you have checked them, or for older children,
                                ask that they bring their treats home. Have other safe treats available at home so you
                                can do swaps for the unsuitable treats
                                Be aware that “treat size” versions of popular brands can contain different ingredients,
                                so make sure you check ingredients lists

                        </div>

                            <h4>Avoid eating or giving out choking hazards</h4>
                            <p class="card-text">Lots of sweets are unfortunately choking hazards, with round / oval
                                boiled sweets being the worst. Check what sweeties are being handed out and siphon off
                                those that don’t feel safe – anything that is very round / grape shaped and hard should
                                be avoided. If your child is older and out with friends, ask them to leave any boiled
                                sweets until they are at home – running around excitedly with friends is really not a
                                sensible time to be consuming these.

                                Marshmallows, especially the mini ones are definitely ones to avoid. They are roughly
                                the same size as a 2-3 year old’s airway, and if swallowed whole can get lodged in the
                                airway, completely obstructing breathing.

                                Around Halloween, there are many incidents involving pedestrians being hit by vehicles.
                                
                                If you are trick or treating, make sure that drivers can see you. It’ll be dark outside, and your scary costume may make you harder to spot, so you must be extra careful.
                                
                                When you cross the road, always do so from a safe location (not between parked cars or on a bend), look both ways, and walk instead of running. You don’t want to give any drivers a fright by appearing out of nowhere in front of them

                                Let’s be honest, carving a pumpkin (or a rock hard swede as it was in my day!) is not the most sensible idea! When it comes to cool and quirky Halloween decorations, pumpkin carving isn’t the only way to go. 

                                For a safer option, why not try painting your pumpkin face with a bright cartoon character or be inventive by painting the whole pumpkin in tasteful gold or silver sparkly paint? Turn ordinary pumpkins into brilliant DIY decorations - there is loads of inspiration online!
